This repository stores translations for all the text strings that appear in CommCare.

The translations for language with language code "xy" should be in a file named "messages_xy.txt".

When adding translations, you can find the default values that should be used in [CommCare Android strings](https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-android/blob/master/app/assets/locales/android_translatable_strings.txt)

These translations are usually updated when doing a major CommCare-Android release by [mobile deploy scripts](https://github.com/dimagi/mobile-deploy/blob/master/update_translations.py)

Note: When adding translations you should typically only need to add them to version 2 of the translations file.
Version 1 is just for backwards compatibility with the previous translations implementation on HQ.
